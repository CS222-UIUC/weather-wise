# WeatherWise
Get the current weather, anywhere, anytime!

WeatherWise helps you make wise weather decisions by providing you with suggestions for the day ahead, 
and showing you related impacts of climate change across the globe. 

This app is built using React and data from the National Weather Service. To access current location, make sure that location privleges are allowed. Otherwise, enter a location within the United States to view its weather.
